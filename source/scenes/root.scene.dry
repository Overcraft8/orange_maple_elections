> *"We should never, never be afraid or ashamed about dreams. The dreams won’t all come true; we won’t always make it; but where there is no vision a people perish. Where people have no dreams and no hopes and aspirations, life becomes dull and a meaningless wilderness."*

 - Tommy Douglas, Premier of Saskatchewan from 1944-1961

This is a game of alternate history. While historical accuracy is a major concern, keep in mind that this is a *game*, and that any divergence from actual events will necessarily have to involve some element of make-believe. Nevertheless, please let the author know if there are any glaring mistakes.

For more information on the politics and government of Saskatchewan, see the "Library" page on the top left. If this is your first time playing the game, it is strongly recommended that you read at least some of this information.

It is a dire time for Saskatchewan. The Great Depression has begun, and the government of James Anderson has been unable to effectively address the crisis. The province is in the midst of a severe drought, and many farmers are on the brink of ruin.

The Farmer-Labour Group (FLG) is the only party offering a real alternative to the old order. However, we are a young and inexperienced party, and we face opposition not only from the right-wing parties but also from within our own ranks, torn between the Agrarian vision of George Williams and the Labour oriented M. J. Coldwell. The FLG's success in the upcoming election will depend on your ability to navigate these challenges and present a compelling vision for the future of Saskatchewan.
