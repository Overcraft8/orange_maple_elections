= Inter-Party Relationships

The FLG cannot govern by itself yet. Because we do not have an electoral majority, we need the support of other parties. Recently, our governments have consisted of the Weimar Coalition of the FLG, RPC, and Democratic parties. We can reach out and build additional connections with these parties, or perhaps we can stand alone.

- @liberals: Strengthen our bonds with the Liberal Party.
- @social_credit: Strengthen our bonds with the Social Credit Party.
- @cp: Work towards repairing relationships with the Communist Party.
- @flg_alone: The FLG can stand alone for now.

The communists are suspicious of our overtures, especially the Stalinist leadership, who persist in calling us "social fascists". However, connections are made at the grassroots and local levels.

@cp_rectification_of_history

One stumbling block for our relations with the CP is our history of conflict, dating back to 1918 and 1919. The CP is especially contemptuous of Gustav Noske, the FLG "bloodhound" who reportedly ordered the violent suppression of the Spartacist uprising and other CP revolts. They also blame us for the deaths of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, two FLG-turned-CP leaders who were killed during the suppression of the uprising.

For further improvements in CP relations, it might be necessary to expel Noske, and hold some sort of commemoration for Luxemburg and Liebknecht.

- @yes_history: Yes, we must apologize for our past actions.
- @no_history: No, we have no need to apologize.

As part of normalizing relations with the CP, we have to acknowledge the wrongdoings of our past. We have expelled Noske, and have held public commemorations for those killed by troops during the uprisings.

This leads to tensions with the moderates and reformists within our party, and criticism from the conservative and liberal parties.

@no_history
on-arrival: cp_relation -= 3

We have no need to apologize for the actions of Ebert and Noske; it is the Communists' fault for launching a violent insurrection.


@cp_2
on-arrival: cp_relation += 8*(1 - dissent); communist_coalition += 1 if cp_inter_party_seen <= 1; reformist_dissent += 2; rpc_relation -= 3; cpc_relation -= 3

After the success of the coalition government with the CP, they are much more amenable to us.

@cp_blutmai
on-arrival: cp_relation += 3*(1 - dissent); reformist_dissent += 1

After the events of Blütmai, reconciling with the Communists is difficult, if not impossible. Nevertheless, we must try.

@social_credit_op
on-arrival: scp_relation += 5*(1 - dissent)

We are currently in opposition to the SCP-led government, but that does not preclude the general building of feelings of good will.

@social_credit_coalition
on-arrival: scp_relation += 8*(1 - dissent)

We are currently coalition partners with them, so improving relations comes naturally.

@social_credit_needham
on-arrival: scp_relation += 5*(1 - dissent)

Needham's Social Credit Party is closely aligned with the ASCP, and is hesitant to align with us.

go-to: cpc_stresemann if stresemann_dead = 0; cpc_moribund if year > 1930

The [+ lpc_name +] has been the dominant party in Saskatchewan since it's birth. Perhaps they can prove worthwhile allies.

@cpc_stresemann
on-arrival: cpc_relation += 8*(1 - dissent)

Gustav Stresemann, the leader of the CPC is the best foreign policy leaders of the republic, and while he has previously expressed monarchist tendencies, he has been friendly towards us.

@cpc_moribund
on-arrival: cpc_relation += 5*(1 - dissent)

The liberal party [+ lpc_name +] is electorally moribund, so perhaps our efforts are best spent elsewhere.

However, given the influence of the CPC among the other right-leaning parties[? if monarch == "George V": and with Monarch George V ?], it can still be helpful to influence them.

@flg_alone

Whether it is because we *cannot* or *will not*, we do not make ties with other parties at this moment.

- @return: Continue...
