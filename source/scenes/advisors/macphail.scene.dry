We have increased funding to Workers' Welfare. [? if black_thursday_seen > 0 : In an age of economic crisis, this will be helpful for improving our standing among the unemployed. ?]

@organizing_women

unavailable-subtitle: [? if advisor_action_timer > 0 : [+ advisor_action_timer +] months before next advisor action. ?]
on-arrival: womens_rights += 1; workers_flp += 4*(1-dissent); rural_flp += 3*(1-dissent); old_middle_flp += 3*(1-dissent); advisor_action_timer = 6

Macphail's strategies for organizing women are aimed at working-class housewives, and acknowledge women's traditional household roles. We argue that our economic welfare programs will improve the livelihoods of women and their families.

[? if flp_r < 50 : Unfortunately, women still disproportionately support the bourgeois parties. ?]
